# Additional plugins

Members of the OpenSearch community have built countless plugins for OpenSearch. While it isn't possible to build an exhaustive list of plugins since many of them are not maintained in the OpenSearch GitHub repository, here are many of them that can be installed by name using `bin/opensearch-plugin install <plugin-name>`.
