# Additional plugins

Members of the OpenSearch community have built countless plugins for OpenSearch. While it isn't possible to provide an exhaustive list (since many plugins are not maintained in an OpenSearch GitHub repository), these are some of the plugins that can be installed by name using the command `bin/opensearch-plugin install <plugin-name>`.
